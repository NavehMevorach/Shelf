                Shelf is an on-demand service that lets you access items, tools,
                and equipment from local businesses, deliver to your door, and
                collect them when you're done. With just a few taps on your
                phone, Shelf will deliver the item to your door and, when you're
                finished with the item, it'll be collected by a Shelf rep.
